# 👋🏾 Hi! I'm Dameris, and I'm on a journey to break into the tech industry as a _full-stack developer_.

Currently studying to sharpen my front and back-end development skills, I am deeply passionate about crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences that leave a lasting impression.
I enjoy diving into coding challenges and collaborating with like-minded individuals to create appealing solutions. I am always open to new opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects that can make a difference.
Feel free to connect with me and let's collaborate!
