# 👋🏾 Hi! I'm Dameris, and I'm on a journey to break into the tech industry as a _front-end developer_.

Currently studying to sharpen my front-end development skills, I am deeply passionate about crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences that leave a lasting impression. With a solid foundation in programming and a voracious thirst for learning, I am eager to embrace new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible in web development.

As a ~~amateur~~ developer 👩🏾‍💻, I enjoy diving into coding challenges and collaborating with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions. I am always open to new opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects that can make a difference.
