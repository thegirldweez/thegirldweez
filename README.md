### Hey!! So happy that you could visit. I'm Dameris, your future favorite _full-stack developer_.

I am an enthusiastic tech student learning front and back-end skills to become a full stack developer. I enjoy diving into coding challenges and collaborating with like-minded individuals.
Full of ideas that I can't wait to build, share and collaborate on. 💫
